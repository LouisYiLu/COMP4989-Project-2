Footnotes:
1,Seasonally adjusted data have been produced using X12 ARIMA seasonal adjustment program.
2,"Travel data for NEXUS Highway, which is a program designed to expedite the border clearance process for low-risk, pre-approved travellers into Canada and the United States, are now included. Monthly data has been revised back to January 2010 to reflect this change."
3,"In 2013, Statistics Canada updated the method used to estimate the number of same-day and overnight commercial plane trips made by United States residents entering Canada via one of the following three airports: Pearson (Toronto), Trudeau (Montréal) and Vancouver. This change created a break in the time series on the number of same-day and overnight commercial air trips made by American residents entering Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Please note that the methodological update does not affect the total number of United States residents travelling to Canada by commercial air. The 2013 and 2014 data on the number of same-day and overnight commercial air trips made by United States residents, however, have been revised."
4,Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding.
